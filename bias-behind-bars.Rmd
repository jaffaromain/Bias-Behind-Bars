title: "Bias in Canada's Prison System DRAFT"

abstract: |
  | The Globe and Mail's 2020 investigation of the Federal prison system found that Black and Indigenous inmates are more likely to get worse scores in their risk assessments than white inmates, simply because of their race. To investigate this further, this report will show findings of an independent analysis conducted using observational data obtained from the Correctional Service of Canada. The same methodology used by the Globe and Mail will be used; a multi-level regression model is used to observe the factors that contribute to a prisoner's score in order to investigate whether there truly is uncovered systemic bias in the risk assessments.
