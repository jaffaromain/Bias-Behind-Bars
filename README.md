# Bias-Behind-Bars

This repository contains code and data for recreating the Globe and Mail's 2020 article, "INVESTIGATION
Bias behind bars: A Globe investigation finds a prison system stacked against Black and Indigenous inmates". The purpose is to replicate the methodology used in the article and summarize results found with regards to the role race plays in prison risk assessments. This repository contains two folders: input and output. After downloading the required data set: 

The input folder contains:

* `Cleaning_data_CSC.R`: An R script that provides the cleaned data set, as well as functions used for exploratory data analysis. This should be run first to obtain the data used for this report. 

* `Models.R`: An R script containing the statistical models built using the cleaned data set.

These scripts must be run first before attempting to knit final report.

Output contains data modified from the input data, the report, a bibliography, and supporting R objects used for producing report.
